# Developer: Generic Training Guide

This guide provides generic training for Developers that works for **any Agility CMS instance**. It focuses on how to integrate and develop with Agility CMS in general, not how a specific instance is configured.

## What This Guide Covers

This generic guide teaches you:
- How Agility CMS APIs work
- How to integrate Agility CMS with frontend frameworks
- How to develop custom components
- How to fetch and cache content
- How to implement preview mode
- How to handle internationalization
- Best practices for development

## Training Modules

1. [Introduction](./01-introduction.md) - What is Agility CMS for Developers?
2. [Architecture](./02-architecture.md) - Headless Architecture and Data Model
3. [Setup](./03-setup.md) - Project Setup and Configuration
4. [API Basics](./04-api-basics.md) - Understanding Agility APIs
5. [Component Development](./05-component-development.md) - Building Components
6. [Content Fetching](./06-content-fetching.md) - Fetching Content Patterns
7. [Caching](./07-caching.md) - Caching Strategies
8. [Preview Mode](./08-preview-mode.md) - Preview Functionality
9. [Internationalization](./09-internationalization.md) - i18n Implementation
10. [Best Practices](./10-best-practices.md) - Development Best Practices

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with Introduction**: Understand Agility CMS from a developer perspective
2. **Review Architecture**: Learn the headless architecture and data model
3. **Set Up Project**: Configure your development environment
4. **Learn APIs**: Understand how to interact with Agility APIs
5. **Build Components**: Create custom components
6. **Master Patterns**: Learn content fetching and caching patterns
7. **Implement Features**: Add preview mode and internationalization
8. **Follow Best Practices**: Apply development best practices

## Key Principles

- **API-First**: All content is accessed via RESTful APIs
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for type-safe content access
- **Component-Driven**: Build reusable components that work with Agility
- **Performance**: Leverage caching and CDN for optimal performance
- **Developer Experience**: Modern SDKs and tooling

## Next Steps

After completing this generic guide:
- Review [Instance-Specific Guide](../instance-specific/README.md) for your specific Agility CMS instance
- Learn project structure and implementation details
- Practice with real content models and components
